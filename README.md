The NPM package
[`juice-shop-ctf-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli)
lets you create a ZIP-archive compatible with [CTFd](https://ctfd.io)'s
data backup format to conveniently populate the platform for a
[Capture the Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security)
event against
[OWASP Juice Shop](http://owasp-juice.shop).

![CLI in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf/master/images/juice-shop-ctf-cli.animated.gif)

> :information_source: The data format generated by `v3.x` of this utility
> has been tested for schema-compatibility with
> [CTFd `≥v1.0.5`](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/releases/tag/1.0.5).

- If using Docker Toolbox on Windows make sure that you also enable port
  forwarding for all required ports from Host `127.0.0.1:XXXX` to
  `0.0.0.0:XXXX` for TCP in the `default` VM's network adapter in
  VirtualBox. For CTFd you need to forward port `8000`.
